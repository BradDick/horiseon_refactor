# horiseon_refactor
Repository for Week 01 Homework Assignment

The overarching aim of this project was to streamline the code in index.html so that it would read more smoothly and clearly, contain less redundancy, and be more accessible.

This modified project exhibits the following changes:
- switch to semantic forms of element names
- addition of accessibility descriptions of images
- elimination of id's in two sections because they were superfluous, given the class properties already indicated therein.

I acknowledge the invaluable assistance of tutor Robert Kurle, Jr. in helping me achieve these goals.
